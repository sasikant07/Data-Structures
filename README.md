# Data-Structures
Data-Structures concepts such as Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Searching, Sorting etc. implemented using Java technology.

# Space Complexity for the graph.
 -> If asked sparse graph then it would be better to use Adjancency List and the space complexity is @(n+2e).
 
 -> If asked about dense graph then it would be better to use Adjancency matrix and the space complexity is @(n^2).
